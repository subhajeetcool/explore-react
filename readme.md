# using create-react-app 
- Have created the basicreact project with the minimum requirements files inside.

# using npm create vite@latest
- Have created the basicvitereact project with the minimum requirements files inside project structure.

- Vite or Parcel is a packages/bundler - for which the files which we create, inside the project it combines them and makes it to single file structure. it will be easy to navigate from dev to production.

- React - 2 types - react-dom ( used for web applications )
                    react-native ( used for mobile applications )

- also have came across through the package.json file for both.

# React flow and structure
- index.html is the only file which runs after the dom manipulation completes which is called as a single page application.

- index.js is the entry point to the source files.
- react creates and virtual dom and compares with the original dom and updates only those particular elements inside dom.
- Through javascript we an render html element - which is called as JSX. 
- "react-scripts" palys a vital role in executing the index.html file.
- by using fragments <>   </> all the html elements will be able to rendered, without fragments jsx only allows single html element to be rendered.
- the first letter of a function name should be upeercase.
- the first letter of component file name should be upeer case.
- in vite react the compoenent file name should be .jsx naming.
